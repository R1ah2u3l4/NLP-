Amazon Review Analysis NLP Project

Overview: 
Problem Statement : It aims to leverage the text data and extract the information to provide recommendations for improving products and customer services. This involves the following steps to  do preprocessing sentiment analysis and improve the summary to improve business insights
Libraries to import are NLTK, Wordcloud, Textblob, FreqDist, Flatten, and CountVectorizer

Business Objectives : Maximize the customer satisfaction
                      Maximize Product Quality and Operational Analysis

Business Constraints : Minimize the Data Preprocessing time including errors and privacy risks

The project involves the following main components:

1) Data Collection: Gathering raw review data from secondary sources 
2) Data Cleaning :
     Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis
     Remove duplicate reviews.
     Handle missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing the rows/columns.
     Remove irrelevant information such as advertisements, URLs, and non-informative text.
4) Text Normalization:
     Convert text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
   - Remove punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
   - Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form
5) Feaature Extraction :  Extracting insights and patterns from the data using techniques like CountVectorizer.
6) Visualization : Visualizing the trends from data to improve model results
